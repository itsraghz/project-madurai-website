      <description>Property flags and descriptors As we know, objects can store properties.
Until now, a property was a simple &amp;ldquo;key-value&amp;rdquo; pair to us. But an object property is actually a more flexible and powerful thing.
In this chapter we&amp;rsquo;ll study additional configuration options, and in the next we&amp;rsquo;ll see how to invisibly turn them into getter/setter functions.
Property flags Object properties, besides a value, have three special attributes (so-called &amp;ldquo;flags&amp;rdquo;):
 writable &amp;ndash; if true, the value can be changed, otherwise it&amp;rsquo;s read-only.</description>

      <description>Property getters and setters There are two kinds of object properties.
The first kind is data properties. We already know how to work with them. All properties that we&amp;rsquo;ve been using until now were data properties.
The second type of properties is something new. It&amp;rsquo;s accessor properties. They are essentially functions that execute on getting and setting a value, but look like regular properties to an external code.
Getters and setters Accessor properties are represented by &amp;ldquo;getter&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;setter&amp;rdquo; methods.</description>
